# RocketLeagueCUE
WIP Rocket League Boost Visualizer.

## Notes

- A lot of this code is shit. This is my first bout with C++ and windows programming in general. I want my Linux back.

- This code was built on top of the CDK SDK "progress" example, which is why folders are named as such. It's possible this code isn't compilable out of box, in which case, toss it in the CUE SDK examples folder, and it should work.

- I only have a Strafe RGB to test on. All other keyboards will have unknown behaviour.
